      <h3>C Language</h3>
      <p>This language was introduced to me in the 1st sem (Introduction to Computing Course) by the professor.
        As it is also the 1st high-level language that became famous so i think it was good to get started with it. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="java-img" src="java.png" alt="Java language">
      <h3>JAVA Language</h3>
      <p>I learnt this language in the Object oriented Programming course of the 2nd semester. The concept of OOPs like inheritence, abstraction etc I came to know about
        while learning JAVA. For DSA, I think it's good to code in JAVA. </p>

    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="html-img" src="HTML.png" alt="HTML">
